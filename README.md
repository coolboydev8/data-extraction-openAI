This Python script summarizes text content extracted from a PDF document page by page using OpenAI's large language model (LLM).

Features:

Summarizes text content from each page of a PDF document.
Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 model for summarization (or specify the actual model used).
Aims to keep summaries concise (less than 200 words by default).
Installation:

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
OpenAI API key (https://platform.openai.com/)
Install required libraries:
Bash
pip install pypdf2  # PDF reading library
# Install the library to interact with OpenAI's API (replace with actual installation command)
Use code with caution.
Set environment variable: Create an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY and set it to your OpenAI API key.
Usage:

Save the script as summarize_pdf.py.
Place your PDF document in the same directory as the script.
Run the script from the command line:
Bash
python summarize_pdf.py
Use code with caution.
Example:

Summary of Page 1:
... (Summarized content of the first page) ...

Summary of Page 2:
... (Summarized content of the second page) ...
How it Works:

The script reads the PDF document using the pypdf2 library.
It iterates through each page and extracts the text content.
The script leverages OpenAI's LLM to summarize the extracted text for each page.
The summarized text is printed to the console.
Customization:

You can modify the script to change the maximum summary length or other parameters as needed.
